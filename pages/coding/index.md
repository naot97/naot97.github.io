### [Yolov4 study](./yolov4_study)
Study the architure, features and results of a  deep learning Yolov4 framework. The main goal of this framework is designing a fast operating
speed of an object detector in production systems and optimization for parallel computations, rather than the low computation volume theoretical indicator (BFLOP). The designed object can be easily trained and used. For example, anyone who uses a conventional GPU to train and test can achieve real-time, high quality.
